# Maths Challenge

This is a basic maths challenge - how quickly can you answer 20 basic arithmetic problems?

It is inspired by and based on a [similar website developed by Sabrina Cruz from Answer in Progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvOkXXprG2g).

When I initially developed this, I kept a git repository for it on my personal Github page. You can view that [here](https://github.com/ellis-burgess/maths-challenge). This version differs in that it uses sessionStorage to keep track of user results across different pages. However, I felt a neater solution here was to keep everything on a single page, and update page elements to display results.
