# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a basic game of rock paper scissors.
The winner is the first to win 5 rounds.

I initially worked on this while undertaking [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open source curriculum for learning web development, and it can be viewed on my personal Github account [here](https://github.com/ellis-burgess/rock-paper-scissors). This iteration has been lightly adapted to integrate with site-wide styles.

This project uses three images from Icons8. From their website:
"You may use our graphic assets without payment for personal or commercial purposes but only on the condition that you include a link to Icons8 in your work. Please note that free assets do come with limitations such as smaller sizes, select file types, and variety." [(source)](https://icons8.com/pricing)

The images used are [hand-scissors](https://icons8.com/icon/44376/hand-scissors), [clenched-fist](https://icons8.com/icon/6643/clenched-fist), and [hand](https://icons8.com/icon/2727/hand). These are also referenced on the page.
