# Calculator

A calculator using Javascript that can do basic calculations (two values with one operation).

Works with button presses or keyboard input.

I initially worked on this while undertaking [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open source curriculum for learning web development, and it can be viewed on my personal Github account [here](https://github.com/ellis-burgess/calculator). This iteration has been lightly adapted to integrate with site-wide styles.
